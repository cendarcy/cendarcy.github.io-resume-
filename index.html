				<p id="first">Hi! I’m Camille, a junior web
				developer building websites in the Philadelphia and New York City areas. </p>
				<p> In June 2016, I finished a 3 month intensive course with the New York Code and Design Academy. I now speak HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby and Ruby on Rails.</p>
				<p> Before entering the program, I worked part-time at the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts at the University of Pennsylvania. I was a student manager and the head assistant to the Reading Room. Having been an assistant manager and liaised between technical and public relations teams, I add value at a multidisciplinary level, connecting ideas where others might not. I have deployed an extensive range of websites spanning in the arts, food, and location services fields.</p>
